# Exercise 45: Make Your Own Game

# For this exercise you are meant to design your own game in the style
# of Exercise 43. I am going to work on developing a Pokemon-type
# game. I don't know how much I will develop the narrative, but I will
# spend the most time creating a relatively rounded combat system
# because this is where I stand to learn the most about how classes,
# objects, and inheritance function. I'll also have to develop
# a way to automate the the opponent's actions

# Use a random system to assign the likelihood of dodging and other AI actions

from random import randint
from sys import exit

# So Pokemon will be dictionaries that store all relevant information
# in keys
